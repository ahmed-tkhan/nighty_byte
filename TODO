1. Buzzer Test
Confirm correct GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO2).
Test simple on/off.
Test PWM/tone generation (if supported).
Test different beep patterns.


2. Pill Box Contact Switch
Confirm correct GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO4).
Test digital read (open/closed).
Test with/without internal pullup.
Debounce logic (if needed).


3. Light Sensor (LDR)
Confirm correct ADC pin (e.g., GPIO36).
Read analog value in bright and dark conditions.
Map ADC value to light level.
Test threshold detection for “dark”.


4. USB Charging Detection
Confirm correct pin (e.g., GPIO39, ADC or digital).
Test voltage or logic level when USB is connected/disconnected.
Confirm detection is reliable and safe for ESP32 input.


5. RTC/Timekeeping
Test time setting and reading.
Test time persistence across resets (if battery-backed).


6. Logging (Flash/SD)
Test writing and reading log entries.
Confirm log persists after reset.


7. WiFi/BLE Connectivity
Test WiFi scan and connect.
Test BLE advertising (if used).
Confirm basic communication (e.g., ping, simple message).
